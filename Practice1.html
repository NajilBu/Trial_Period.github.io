    <pre>
        I recall when you said that you would never leave me
        You told me more, so much more, like when the time you whispered in my ear
        There was heaven in my heart
        I remember when you said that you'd be here forever

        Then you left without even saying that you're leaving
        I was hurt, and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday
        And I prayed that you would stay
        But then you're gone and, oh, so far away

        I was afraid this time would come
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within
        I have learned to live my life beside you
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight

        And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again
        I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end
        Then you left without even saying that you're leaving
        I was hurt, and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday

        And I prayed that you would stay
        But then you're gone and, oh, so far away
        I was afraid this time would come
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within

        I have learned to live my life beside you
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight
        And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again
        I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end, woh oh

        I was afraid this time would come
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within
        I have learned to live my life beside you
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight

        And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again
        I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end

        Keep on dreaming till my heartaches end
